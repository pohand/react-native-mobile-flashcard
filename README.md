This is the final project for the [React Nanodegree @ Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

## App Description

_*Flashcards*_ it's an app that lets you create learning flashcards, gouped in decks. You can create as many decks as you want. Then, you can add cards to the decks.
Each card will need to have a question and an answer.

Once a deck has at least one question, you can "take the quiz".
Quiz mode will show you the questions you created one by one. Then you have to select if you know the answer or not.

If you don't know the answer, then the answer will be presented to you.

After you go through all the questions you'll see your final score and an animation.

## Installation

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```
or
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
